            The first of the hardest decisions for us to make came when we were narrowing down what
            elements to leave in the top navigation bar. We decided to go with "About Us," "Academics,"
            "Research," "Admissions" and "Athletics." We decided to leave out "Campus Life" or "Student
            Life" because we felt that this was something prospective or current students would look for,
            therefore, it could be placed as an element within those sites. It also didn't seem like an
            element that would draw a lot of traffic to the site like the other elements would, therefore,
            it didn't need to be placed in the top navigation bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another tough decision came in form of deciding between a top navigation bar only, user
            pathway navigation bar only or a combination of both. We felt that both navigation bars were
            necessary to help guide users on the website. One bar alone didn't seem like it could do an
            efficient job at helping users get to desired information.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the "About Us" section, it was hard to decide what we felt belonged because this content
            relies on what other navigation elements are displayed. For example, University of Washington
            has an "Admissions" element under "About Us" but we decided against doing that for our own
            "About Us" because a separate "Admissions" element will already be displayed on the main
            navigation bar. In addition, we combined some elements into one element. We decided to use
            "Who We Are" as an element to encompass "History," "Administration," and
            "Statement of Purpose." We eliminated "President's Message," "Economic Impact,"
            "Strategic Plan" from what was originally under "About Us" on the University of Louisiana
            website. Elements like "Net Price Calculator," "Voluntary System," and "House Resolution"
            seem misplaced and we feel they should be moved to different categories (i.e. Financial Aid)
          </p>
          <p>
            These seemed to be the most difficult decisions we made during the project. The other elements
            seemed relatively clear as to what elements to keep and eliminate based on the observations
            we made of other university websites.
